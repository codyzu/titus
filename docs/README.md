## Create Fullstack App

Titus is an adrenaline booster shot for development velocity.
It facilitates an immediate ramp-up of development velocity for new projects by eliminating the heavy burden of researching and choosing tooling.
The Titus project believes that **the precious development resources spent during the initial phase of a new project are best spent implementing user facing features that have tangible impact on a project.**

Titus is a starter kit that provides just enough to start a new project using modern open source tools:
* React front-end (no CSS or component framework included... byoCSS)
* Node.js back-end with [Fastify]
* authentication support (Auth0, AWS Cognito, or Azure Active Directory)
* front and backend test suites with [Jest] and [Storybook]
* easily deployed to major cloud providers
* one page included out of the box allowing for plug-and-play

Titus has a single goal: **give a project just enough to get start without getting in the way**.

The tooling provided with Titus has been chosen by a diverse group of highly experienced developers.
The motto is, the best tooling is the tooling that just works.
There will be newer, hotter, and interesting features in other tooling.
However Titus tooling is production proven to eliminate unforeseen surprises, incompatibilities, and shortcomings.
The team behind Titus values fresh perspectives and continuous improvement.
Those values are reflected in the tooling choices and changes over time.
Titus should be the best today and evolve to be the best tomorrow.

## Overview
Titus is an application development and deployment stack suitable for SaaS solutions. It provides a ready to deploy frontend, backend and database and includes infrastructure and service tooling for continuous integration and deployment.

Titus helps you create high quality software applications and documentation faster and more efficiently. It looks like this:

We provide everything you need to start deploying features in a production-ready, scalable manner.

## Built for Developers
Developer experience using Titus is first class. We want you as a developer to enjoy using Titus so much that it becomes your stack of choice.

Titus is well documented, includes modern tooling, for example, [Storybook], and has linting and testing as first-class citizens. Titus supports common-sense inclusions such as quality logging and Docker convenience commands for day-to-day building and working with the stack locally.

## No compromise DevOps
Titus comes with a full set of scripted functionality for continuous integration and deployment. This allows you to decide which CI/CD server to use on a case by case basis. 

The primary goal of Titus is to enable you to build your new features straight away. We use a modern deployment pipeline to ensure you can deliver continuously.

By default, Titus makes use of GitHub Actions as its Continuous Integration and Deployment server. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is the default cloud provider.

## You decide the details
Perhaps the most important feature of Titus is its simplicity. There are no CSS decisions, no deviation from standard linting rules and no clever frontend framework to get tangled up with.

We understand these things vary from project to project, so we get out of your way and let you make those decisions. We just make sure you can build and deploy those decisions with ease.
